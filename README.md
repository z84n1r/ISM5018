1. Unit description
The unit Fashion, Art and Cultural Context will introduce you to a comprehensive critical analysis and evaluation of fashion intended as a socio-cultural global phenomenon and provide you with the theoretical knowledge necessary to interpret fashion practices in relation to art movements and other cultural manifestations.
Taught across three terms, the unit will adopt a diachronic approach to the study and evolution of fashion practices since the Industrial Revolution; nonetheless, whenever appropriate it will also adopt a thematic approach aiming at exploring the relationship established between fashion, art, and the cultural framework within which these operate.
